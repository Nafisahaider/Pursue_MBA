## Visualizing a Decision Tree Model using Scikit-learn
This project demonstrates how to build and visualize a decision tree model using the `scikit-learn` library. The goal is to classify or predict outcomes based on the input data provided in a CSV file (`mba_decision_dataset.csv`).

## Features
- Build a decision tree classifier using `scikit-learn`.
- Visualize the decision tree structure for better interpretability.
- Evaluate the model's performance using classification metrics.

## Dataset
The dataset used is `mba_decision_dataset.csv`, which contains data for predicting or classifying decisions. Ensure the dataset is available in the same directory as the script or notebook.

## Requirements
- Python 3.7 or higher
- Libraries:
  - scikit-learn
  - pandas
  - matplotlib
  - graphviz (optional, for advanced tree visualization)

Install the required libraries using the following command:
```bash
pip install scikit-learn pandas matplotlib graphviz
```
